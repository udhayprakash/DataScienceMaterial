Thank you for agreeing to complete this technical assessment!

We have a real-world example of the sort of work we do at Roscommon Analytics.
This is fairly representative of the type of work you would start out on contributing,
and is a good intro relevant markets.

Introduction:

Financial Transmission Rights (FTR) allow market participants to offset potential losses (hedge) related to the price risk of delivering energy to the grid. FTRs are a financial contract entitling the holder to a stream of revenues (or charges) based on the day-ahead hourly congestion price difference across an energy path [PJM].

The Project:

Please create an application and database to calculate the FTR profits and calculate the Profit or Loss for each Market Participant in the New England Electricity Operator's FTR Market over a one month time period.

Implementation Notes:

There is no time limit or hard deadline. Once you've looked this over, propose a reasonable date to review your results
The main requirement is that you use Python.
Good free Python IDEs are https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ or https://code.visualstudio.com/, but feel free to use any tools you would like.
Highly recommend you use pandas as heavily in your application for the pure python implementation
A secondary requirement is to make use of a database in your solution as well as in memory or file based solution.
MySQL or SQLite are free and quick to setup


Background:

ISO New England (or "ISO-NE") operates the Electricity Grid for New England, as well as an FTR Market on that grid

A "Financial Transmission Right" or FTR is a contract to pay/receive the difference in local electricity costs at 2 specific points
Specifically, FTR's are concerned w/the difference in cost caused by congestion on the electricity grid along the path between the 2 points
FTRs allow energy generators to hedge against the possibility of congestion causing fluctuations in the delivery price of power, somewhat similar to a Futures contract
FTRs allow Financial Players to speculate on the possibility of congestion (also similar to Futures contracts)
FTRs allow grid operators to harness market forces to manage congestion over time, ultimately delivering power across the grid more cheaply
FTRs are awarded to both Generators and Financial Players (known as "Market Participants") in scheduled Auctions
Market Participants submit bids for FTRs in each Auction
Grid operators run an analysis to minimize expected power delivery cost across the entire grid, and awards FTRs to winning bids constrained by the analysis results
FTRs are either "OnPeak" or "OffPeak", meaning each one covers non-overlapping periods of either the high-demand or low-demand electricity grid hours.
Annual Auctions award FTRs for a specific path between 2 grid points ( "Source" and "Sink" ) for all OnPeak or OffPeak hours in the entire calendar year (Jan-Dec)
Monthly Auctions award FTRs between a Source and Sink that cover the hours in one month
The "Quantity" of an FTR is often reported in Megawatts (MW) for the time period (monthly or annual). To get the contract size of the FTR you must multiply by the number of hours in the period (for the peak type).
The profit or loss on an FTR is the revenue generated by an FTR, minus the auction cost
Every day the "Day Ahead Locational Marginal Price" or "LMP" is published by the ISO
The LMP has 3 components: [ Energy, Congestion, Loss ] - the component most relevant to FTRs is Congestion
The Daily Revenue for an FTR is (Congestion price at Sink - Congestion price at Source) * MW (for each hour in the day for the corresponding peak type).
Requirements:

Write a Python module or script to:
Download more recent ISONE Long Term Auction Results, as well as each of the Monthly Auction Results for the current year to date
Download LMPs for a completed month of the current or prior year
Combine the FTR Awards across Auctions to generate FTR Positions per Market Participant, and calculate the cost of each FTR Position
Use the daily LMP data to calculate FTR Revenue for each Market Participant for each day in the most recently completed month of the current year
For each FTR calculate the PNL and then sum up the PNL for each Participant

Auction results: https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/auctions/-/tree/auction-results-ftr
For this challenge, you’ll need to gather:
Annual auction results (both rounds)
The set of monthly auctions that span the month you are calculating (each monthly auction has all of remaining months in the calendar year).

Don't worry about partially funded FTRs, or any other non-standard FTR situations you may see referenced including node changes/updates


Notes:

The ISONE Auction Awards column "Award FTR Price" units are $/MW_Period - the Annual awards value is the cumulative cost for all (OnPeak or OffPeak) hours in the year.  Similarly the Monthly "Award FTR Price" looks like the cost for all OnPeak/OffPeak hours in a month.  You'll probably want to normalize these values to $/MW_Hour, after calculating the total # of hours in the period for each of OnPeak/OffPeak.
