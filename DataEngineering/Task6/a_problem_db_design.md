# Database design question:

    Let's saying you are building an application for a ticketing system. A ticket is created when a guest staying at hotel calls into our help desk for problems or technical assistance with connecting to the Wi-Fi. Each ticket must contain the name of the person who is calling for support and which hotel the person is staying (property).

    The ticket will also have optional comments. When a ticket is first created, it will not have any comments. As employees who work at our help desk troubleshoot the guest's problem connecting to the Wi-Fi, they will add comments in a ticket. Each comments must have an author, who is someone who works at the help desk, a body and a creation time.

    Each person who works at our help desk is an author. Each author must have a name, id and email address.

# Database query:

    Write a database query. Return all the comments for a single ticket. Return any unique identifiers, the comment body, creation time, and the author's name.

# Design an API:

    ANY LANGUAGE: Using any language or library of your choice, make an HTTP GET request to the Dogs API. You want to get the URL of a dog photo at random. For the documentation, see https://dog.ceo/dog-api/.
